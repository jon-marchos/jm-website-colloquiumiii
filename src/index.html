            <b>ABSTRACT:</b>
          </div>
          <p>
            The USDA recommends that individuals spend at<br>
            least 280.95 a month on average to afford<br>
            economic, healthy meals. Per USDA statistics,<br>
            10% of a household‚Äôs salary should be<br>
            invested in order to purchase these meals<br>
            comfortably, estimating that an income of<br>
            33,714 USD is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of New York City, 82<br>
            neighborhoods make an average median income<br>
            less than this threshold. This encompasses 650<br>
            thousand people around the city, slightly over<br>
            the populations of Boston and Detroit. Food<br>
            insecurity makes individuals more prone to<br>
            malnutrition, resulting in increased risks<br>
            of high blood pressure, diabetes and other<br>
            diet-related health problems.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Admittedly, this only scratches the surface‚Äì<br>
            there are far more variables that encompass<br>
            what makes a neighborhood food insecure.<br>
            <i>Biting the Big Apple</i> will go through a<br>
            comprehensive deep dive of New York City‚Äôs food<br>
            insecurity, elaborating what food insecurity is<br>
            in the context of NYC, where food insecurity is<br>
            most prevalent, why it is important to address<br>
            food insecurity, what does food insecurity look<br>
            like, and how food insecurity can be tackled<br>
            throughout the city.

        <b>01: WHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY</b>
      </div>
      <p>
        Food insecurity is the inability to comfortably<br>
        access affordable, healthy dietary options.<br>
        In the context of New York City, it takes two forms:<br>
        <li><b>Food Desert: </b>Areas that have both poor<br>
        proximity to healthy food options and also<br>
        cannot afford it </li><br>
        <li><b>Food Swamp: </b> Areas that have good<br>
        physical proximity to healthy food options,<br>
        but populace has difficulty affording it</li><br>
        On the contrary, there's also:<br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Food Oasis: </b>Areas that have good physical<br>
        proximity to healthy food options and where populace<br>
        can afford it</li><br>

      </p>
      <p>
        In incumbent investigations by the USDA, food insecurity<br>
        is mostly emphasized by the lack of physical proximity<br>
        (10 mile radius) to a supermarket. However, since NYC<br>
        is so dense, the term "food swamp" must be used to discuss the<br>
        lack of economical access to healthier options. In order<br>
        to truly discuss which neighborhoods are riddled with<br>
        food insecurity, various investigations and correlations<br>
        of data such as income, supermarket and bodega counts,<br>
        median rent and vehicle counts are all correlated to<br>
        paint NYC's food insecurity landscape<br>

        <p>In order to get a comprehensive understanding<br>
        where food insecurity is most prevalent, it is<br>
        essential to take in data from various sources.<br>
        In these investigations, various infrastructural<br>
        datasets (i.e. supermarket counts, vehicle prevalence)<br>
        are correlated with various economic parameters<br>
        (i.e. Average median income, food stamp prevalence)<br>
        to identify conditions of what makes a place<br>
        food insecure.<br>
      <br>
        Based on these results, three different neighborhoods<br>
        will be chosen: one food oasis, swamp and desert. These<br>
        areas will be investigated further in a qualitative<br>
        manner, completing the definition of food insecurity<br>
        that the numbers in these quantitative presentations<br>
        cannot articulate.<br>

        <p>Though the 33,714 USD cutoff for affording<br>
        healthy meals is a good indicator for understanding<br>
        neighborhoods with financial difficulties, it could<br>
        also be justified with another financial parameter--<br>
        rent. According to many major financial institutions,<br>
        such as SoFi and Chase, it is recommended that families<br>
        should invest less than 30% of their income towards<br>
        rent/mortgage in order to be financially sound.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this particular graph, there is a comparison<br>
        between the %of income that goes towards food, and<br>
        the %of income that goes towards rent, with the<br>
        dashed red lines representing the recommended<br>
        financial cutoffs. Neighborhoodsthat exceed both of<br>
        these cutoffs are prime candidates that are more<br>
        vulnerable to food insecurity. In this case, these<br>
        neighborhoods get a distinction gives them more<br>

        <div class="spacer">
          <p>In certain areas, especially in the outskirts<br>
          of New York City, neighborhoods tend to become<br>
          more sparsely populated, with infrastructure<br>
          being more spread out. In these investigations,<br>
          these can mistakenly read as places that may have<br>
          more difficulty with accessing adequate nutritious<br>
          infrastructure.<br>
          <br>
          The graph is divided into three groups: one where<br>
          there are lower amounts of supermarkets but<br>
          compensated with higher vehicle ownership (blue),<br>
          one where there are less vehicles but enough<br>
          supermarkets accessible to the public (green),<br>
          and most importantly, one where there are<br>
          inadequate amounts of vehicle ownership and<br>
          supermarket infrastructure. This ultimately<br>
          filters out any false positives regarding any<br>
          neighborhoods that may be seen as food insecure<br>

        <div class="spacer">
          <p>When it comes to the food infrastructure of Starrett<br>
          City, there are only two supermarkets in the entire<br>
          neighborhood. Outside of these supermarkets, the food<br>
          options mostly involve fast food, dominated by chain<br>
          establishments (i.e. Dunkin, Sarku Japan, etc.) that<br>
          take up Starrett City's retail spaces. With 52% of<br>
          the neighborhood having food stamps, it is also evident<br>
          that healthier options are more difficult to obtain<br></p>
          <br>
          <p>Starrett City's infrastructure is mostly apartment<br>
          complexes, with two strip malls. The strip malls also have<br>
          vast amounts of parking space too, which is ironic<br>
          considering the general lack of automobile vehicle usage<br>
          in comparison to other neighborhoods.</p>

        <div class="spacer">
          <p>CH-N differentiates itself from the food desert<br>
          example by having denser infrastructure-- especially<br>
          with a greater amount of supermarkets overall, unlike<br>
          Starrett City which only has two. However, the<br>
          presence of fast-food options is similar to its food<br>
          desert counterpart is prevalent-- bodegas and fast food<br>
          choices still outnumber supermarket infrastructure.<br>
          With around 45% of their populace also using food stamps,<br>
          it is clear that financial assistance is needed to<br>
          access healthier options.<br></p>
          <br>
          <p>CH-N has much more variety when it comes to<br>
          infrastructure, unlike Starrett City which is mainly<br>
          composed of High Rise buildings, strip malls and asphalt<br>
          lots. The density of their infrastructure also makes<br>
          the lack of vehicles not as much of a problem, as this<br>
          offset by plentiful access to the MTA Subway and Bus<br>
          lines.

        <p><b>Food Oasis: Sunset Park</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="spacer">
        <p>Sunset Park differentiates itself from its food<br>
          insecure counterparts by offering a dense supermarket<br>
          network, with almost every block having a food vendor.<br>
          Unlike supermarkets in Starrett City or Central Harlem-<br>
          North, Sunset Park proudly displays their produce<br>
          outside of their premises, and even allot smaller venues<br>
          to have fresh produce, which would've otherwise read as<br>
          fast food restaurants or cornerstores in the food-insecure<br>
          neighborhoods.<br>
          <br>
          With only 28% of residents using food stamps, and having<br>
          median incomes similar to Central Harlem-North, along with<br>
          similar building typologies, Sunset Park sets a good example<br>
          of how lower-income neighborhoods can still have ample<br>
          access to healthier options at an affordable price. Ultimately,<br>
          Sunset Park minimizes the presence of fast food restaurants,<br>
          in favor of local vendors.<br>

        <b>WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?</b><br>
        Case Study I: Food Desert, Ocean Hill
      </div>
      <div class="spacer">
        <p>There are various incumbent practices that tackle<br>
          food insecurity throughout the City, such as <i>In God's</i><br>
          <i>Love We Deliver</i>, which deliver groceries to those over<br>
          the age of 65 and have difficulty accessing healtlhy<br>
          infrastructure. There are also other Public food insecurity<br>
          sources, such as the NYCC food distribution program, where<br>
          those with children attending school can have their families<br>
          benefit by getting adequeate meals a day. Other practices<br>
          can also be local to specific neighborhoods, such as church<br>
          food distributions and local cart vendors.<br>
          <br>
          However, all of these solutions have limitations-- in order to<br>
          be sustainable, they must keep their audiences small. Practices<br>
          with too universal of an audience would be too expensive, and<br>
          would either cut corners or quickly fizzle out. Each neighborhood<br>
          is also different in terms of their infrastructure, populace, and<br>
          history. In order to create a proper solution, it is essential<br>
          to simulate how these incumbent solutions impact their<br>
          neighborhoods, and which ones would work best together and vice<br>
          versa.</p>

        <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="spacer">
        <p>Food insecurity affects many neighborhoods<br>
          in New York in different ways, whether it‚Äôs<br>
          through lack of healthy infrastructure, or<br>
          the inability to afford healthy options. <br>
          Though there are many incumbent programs<br>
          managing the food insecurity issue in the city,<br>
          most of them reach out to a smaller clientele<br>
          in order to maintain the quality of their<br>
          outreach. Trying to create a one-size-fits-all<br>
          solution that could encompass the whole city<br>
          would not only be extremely expensive, but<br>
          would also be unsustainable to properly feed a<br>
          food-insecure population of over 600,000<br>
          individuals.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Within these neighborhood-scale studies, it<br>
          is essential to note that their respective<br>
          infrastructures and populace are different.<br>
          There can be cases where food insecurity<br>
          takes the form of an area with an abundance of<br>
          fast-food establishments and a lack of supermarket<br>
          access. There can also be cases where food<br>
          insecurity comes from a sparsely populated area<br>
          with a majority senior-citizen demographic that<br>
          have a harder time taking the trip to their local<br>
          vendors. The simulations above show how it is<br>
          important not to look at just one solution, but<br>
          rather to mix and match different solutions<br>
          that tailor the demographics and resources<br>
          these neighborhoods have.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Ultimately, <i>Biting the Big Apple</i> is<br>
          a stern message to NYC‚Äôs government: it has the<br>
          responsibility of allocating these programs<br>
          depending on what makes the most sense for these<br>
          particular neighborhoods. This process is only a<br>
          start, as it uses existing infrastructure‚Äì long<br>
          term, the City has to implement permanent foundations<br>
          in order to maintain the healing process these<br>
          introductory interventions offer.</p>
